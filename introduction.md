# Project Introduction 
### The description of the problem and discussion of the background
(Hypothetical situation) My friend Mac owns some shops for rent in Hong Kong. Recently, one of tenants planned to move. After he did some researches, he has a plan to invite one of the below 2 chains to move into his shop (and he is sure both of them are interested to expend their business):
1. McDonxxx's ("the M" for short): a American fast food restaurant chain serves over 69 million customers daily in over 100 countries across approximately 40,000 outlets. And there are around 200 outlets in Hong Kong
1. Starbxxxs ("the S" for short): a coffeehouse chain found in Seattle, operating around 28,000 coffee shops worldwide, including around 150 coffee shops in Hong Kong.

But, my friend Mac is not sure if his place fits the M's shop or the S's shop, and he do not know if there are any data can answer the question. So, he came to me for help. We did some discussions and finally we think: 

*We can use data analytics to analysis the nearby venues of the two chains in Hong Kong. And see if the nearby venues of my friend's place are simular to the M's or the S's. So we can try to use the mechine learning Classification method to classify Mac's shop into Class M or Class S according to the all nearby venues data of the existing known M's and S's shops.*
